## 🧩 System Design & Architecture
Our system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver accurate, plain-language export compliance guidance to SMEs.

### 🏗️ Application Design using RAG Architecture

**How the Architecture Works:**

1.  **User Query:** An SME user enters a natural language question (e.g., "Can I export skincare cream to Singapore?"). 💬
2.  **Embedding and Retrieval:** The query is converted into an embedding using Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2. A similarity search is performed against pre-computed embeddings of legal documents stored in an Amazon S3 vector bucket. The system retrieves the most relevant law/regulation chunks to provide accurate legal context. 📂
3.  **LLM Reasoning with Amazon Nova Lite:** The retrieved legal text is passed to Amazon Nova Lite, which is instructed to generate a response that combines legal accuracy (citations) with practical usability (action steps, permits required, HS code suggestions). 💡
4.  **Result Delivery:** The AI returns a final JSON answer including item classification, HS code, estimated fees, taxes, required permits, limitations, and legal sources. 📈
